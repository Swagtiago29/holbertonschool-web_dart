Introduction
This project teaches Dart asynchronous programming - essential for handling operations that take time like API calls, file reading, or database queries. You’ll learn to use async/await syntax, work with Future objects, handle errors properly, and make real HTTP requests to external APIs. Asynchronous programming prevents your app from freezing while waiting for slow operations to complete. The project uses the Rick and Morty API for practical examples, so you’ll be fetching interdimensional character data while understanding non-blocking code because even Rick would appreciate code that doesn’t freeze the multiverse!
